# Image To ASCII Art
<h3>How to use</h3>
<h6>Note: this program only works with bitmap images, i might add functionality to other image formats in future.</h6>
To use you just have to type in the image name including format (example: ducks.bmp). Image has to be in the same directory as the executable.

I added some example bmp images in images/ folder.
